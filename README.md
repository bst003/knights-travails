# knights-travails

A knight in chess can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess
board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.

The goal of this project is to build a function knightMoves that shows
the shortest possible way to get from one square to another
by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.
