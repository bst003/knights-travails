NOTES

Create Knight "node" with all possible options it could go to?
    Could work similar to social netowk graph
    Would have to accomodate for 8 children at points
        Level order traversal? - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86g8jAQug04
        Could get exponentially larger with each move
    Would this lead to an infinite loop?
    Where does game board come in on this solution?

Create gameboard similar to Tic Tac Toe board?
